Bilstein is one of the bigger and better known suppliers of dampers and they have a long history of supplying dampers for every kind of Porsche, be it for a street car or for a full out racing car. They sponsored many racing series with their dampers, especially in the past.

Apart from the historic value of Bilstein their dampers perform really well (as long as you choose the right one;) ). I will post more on this later, for now I will refer you to the excellent information posted by Dennis Grant in his Autocross to Win series: [Shock Buyer's Guide](farnorthracing.com/autocross_secrets18.html).

Officially Bilstein only manufactures three dampers for the 1303 Super Beetle at the moment, 1 damper insert for the front and 2 rear dampers. Fortunately there are a lot more dampers available for other cars that can be used on the Super Beetles as well :)
