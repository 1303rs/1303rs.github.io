One of the most common upgrades for a Super Beetle, or for any IRS Beetle, is upgrading the rear drum brakes to disc brakes. Even though it isn't necessary to replace the complete rear suspension to achieve this, many people choose to replace the stock Beetle IRS trailing arms with the trailing arms of a Porsche 944. This of course not only means a switch to disc brakes but also allows the use of Porsche wheels as well.

The Porsche 944 trailing arms will be the subject of this post; which ones are available, what are their differences and why would you choose one over the other...

There are basically 2 different trailing arm configurations available for the 944: Welded steel trailing arms or cast aluminium trailing arms. The cast aluminum trailing arms are available in three different versions which differ only in having a protrusion for the bump-stop and having a mounting hole available for an ABS sensor. So in the total the following types of trailing arms exist:
- Welded steel trailing arms
- Cast aluminium trailing arms
  - With bump-stop, without ABS
  - With bump-stop, with ABS
  - Without bump-stop, with ABS

### Welded steel trailing arms
Part numbers: 944 331 021 00 (Left), 944 331 022 00 (Right)

The welded steel trailing arms were used on the early Porsche 944's, which are commonly referred to as "early offset", "type 1" or "phase 1". They are practically the same as the stock Super Beetle welded steel trailing arms. There are people who say they have been reinforced compared to the Beetle trailing arms and there are people who say they are exactly the same. I haven't cut one into pieces so I can't prove either of these statements ;) What I do know is that they are exactly the same from the outside as the stock Super Beetle trailing arms.

The only gain you have from using these is if you bought a complete set including the brake mounting plate and the wheel hubs. The 944 brake-mounting plate makes it possible to use disc brakes (but you don't have to swap trailing arms for that, the brake mounting plate can be bolted to the 1303 trailing arm instead of the 1303's drum brake mounting plate). The wheel hubs obviously make it possible to use Porsche wheels.
Furthermore you gain camber and toe adjustment which the stock 1303 rear suspension doesn't offer.

### Cast aluminium trailing arms
For model year 1986 (august 1985) all 944's underwent many changes and upgrades; so many changes in fact that all 944's from model year 1986 onward are referred to as "late offset", "type 2" or "phase 2". One of the many changes was a complete replacement of the rear suspension where instead of the welded steel trailing arms of the older models a pair of cast aluminium trailing arms was used.

These cast aluminium trailing arms come in two different variations. The only difference between these is that the ones delivered on vehicles from model year 1986 had a protrusion for the bump-stop (which was mounted on the chassis) and the trailing arms from model year 1987 onward don't. For model year 1987 the bump-stop on the chassis was removed and a regular bump-stop was placed on the damper. Because of this the bump-stop protrusion on the trailing arm became redundant, so Porsche removed it from the casting.

Since model year 1986 ABS became an optional upgrade and from model year 1987 became standard. Because of this the early cast aluminium trailing arms with the bump-stop protrusion are available with and without the mounting holes for ABS sensors and the later cast aluminium trailing arms without the bump-stop protrusion always have the mounting holes for ABS sensors.

### Differences in track width
One of the most significant differences between the type 1 early steel, type 2 early cast aluminium and type 2 late cast aluminium suspensions is supposedly the increase in track width with every newer version. This increase in track width has actually almost nothing to do with the trailing arms. It is caused by a spacer on the early 944's (21mm for the regular 944, optional 28mm) and by the larger width of the wheel-flange on the late 944's.
A complete 1986 944 (without ABS) rear suspension will have cast aluminium trailing arms with the bump-stop protrusion and a early offset wheel-flange. A complete 1987 and later 944 rear suspension will have cast aluminium trailing arms without the bump-stop protrusion and with late offset wheel-flanges.

The increase in track over the stock 1303 rear suspension is as follows:
- Early 944 steel trailing arms with 944 Flange and 21mm spacer: 21mm
- Late 944 cast aluminium trailing arms with early offset wheel-flanges: 22mm
- Late 944 cast aluminium trailing arms with late offset wheel-flanges: +- 70mm (still have to measure)
